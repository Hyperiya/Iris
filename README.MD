## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Spotify desktop client with Spicetify installed*
- Discord desktop client*
- Valid Hoyoverse account*

(*- If you don't have any of these at all, this app won't be of any use for you whatsoever.)

### Compiling the Application yourself
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hyperiya/Iris
cd Iris/Iris

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile application
npm run make
```

```bash
# Install Spicetify extension
cd Iris-Extension/iris-link
npm install

# Compile the extention yourself
npm run build
```

### Quick Start
1. (If applicable) Start the application in development mode:
```bash
cd App
npm start
```

2. Enable desired modules in the settings menu (accessible via the gear icon in the titlebar)

3. Connect your accounts:
   - Spotify: Click the button to install the extention, ensuring you have Spicetify, and that it works properly. If you compiled the extention yourself, make sure that the extention is applied.
   - Discord: Enter in your client ID and client Secret from https://discord.com/developers/applications (Make a new application) and grant permissions when prompted
   - Hoyoverse: Log in through the settings menu

### More Detailed Examples
#### Spotify Controls
```typescript
// Control playback
await spotifyService.playPause();
await spotifyService.seek(timeInMs);
await spotifyService.setVolume(volumeLevel);
```

#### Discord Voice Integration
```typescript
// Join voice channel
window.discord.voice.join(channelId);

// Toggle audio states
window.discord.voice.mute();
window.discord.voice.deafen();
```

### Troubleshooting
#### Common Issues
1. Spotify Connection Failed
   - Ensure Spicetify is properly installed
   - Check if the Spotify client is running
   - Verify the extension is built and installed correctly

2. Discord RPC Not Working
   - Restart Discord client
   - Check if Discord is running with proper permissions
   - Verify the Discord application ID is correct

3. Hoyoverse API Errors
   - Verify login credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure correct server region is selected

## Data Flow
Iris manages real-time data flow between multiple services through WebSocket connections and IPC channels.

```ascii
[Spotify Client] <-> [Spicetify Extension] <-> [WebSocket] <-> [Electron Main] <-> [React UI]
[Discord Client] <-> [Discord RPC] <-> [IPC Bridge] <-> [Electron Main] <-> [React UI]
[Hoyoverse API] <-> [HTTP Client] <-> [Service Layer] <-> [Electron Main] <-> [React UI]
```

Key interactions:
- Spotify playback state is synchronized through WebSocket connection
- Discord voice states are managed through RPC and IPC channels
- Hoyoverse game data is fetched through authenticated HTTP requests
- UI updates are managed through React state management
- Theme colors are dynamically extracted from album artwork
