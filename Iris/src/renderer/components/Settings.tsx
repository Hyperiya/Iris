Section 2 -- Scope.<br/>
<br/>
a. License grant.<br/>
<br/>
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br/>
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br/>
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br/>
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br/>
<br/>
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br/>
               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and<br/>
<br/>
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for<br/>
               NonCommercial purposes only.<br/>
<br/>
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br/>
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br/>
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br/>
          its terms and conditions.<br/>
<br/>
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br/>
          6(a).<br/>
<br/>
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br/>
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br/>
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br/>
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br/>
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br/>
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br/>
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br/>
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br/>
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br/>
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br/>
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br/>
<br/>
       5. Downstream recipients.<br/>
<br/>
            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br/>
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br/>
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br/>
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br/>
               Public License.<br/>
<br/>
            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.<br/>
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You<br/>
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to<br/>
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material<br/>
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.<br/>
<br/>
            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br/>
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br/>
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br/>
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br/>
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br/>
               Material.<br/>
<br/>
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br/>
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br/>
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br/>
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br/>
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br/>
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br/>
<br/>
b. Other rights.<br/>
<br/>
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br/>
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br/>
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br/>
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br/>
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br/>
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br/>
          Rights, but not otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br/>
          Public License.<br/>
<br/>
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br/>
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br/>
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br/>
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br/>
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br/>
          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when<br/>
          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial<br/>
          purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br/>
following conditions.<br/>
<br/>

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br/>
          form), You must:<br/>

               with the Licensed Material:<br/>
<br/>
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br/>
                    Material and any others designated to receive<br/>
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br/>
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br/>
                    designated);<br/>
<br/>

AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br/>
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br/>
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br/>
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br/>
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br/>

DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br/>
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br/>

     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br/>
     of this Public License.<br/>
<br/>
c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br/>

be made without permission under this Public License.<br/>
<br/>
b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br/>
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br/>
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br/>
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br/>
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br/>
conditions.<br/>
<br/>
c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br/>
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br/>
Licensor.<br/>
<br/>
d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br/>
as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br/>
that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br/>
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.<br/>
